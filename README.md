## KV-store

#### Description
This is a service which provides both a websocket server and a REST endpoint built with [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/). The websocket server accepts messages containing any key-value pair and stores it in [Redis](https://redis.io/)* (managed cloud instance).
The REST endpoint accepts GET requests specifying a key and it returns the corresponding value for that key or a HTTP error in case the key does not exist.


#### API documentation
Documentation was generated using [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) and can be accessed at 127.0.0.1:3000/documentation.
You can specify the server port using the **PORT** env variable.

#### Project installation
1. Clone project
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. Add a `.env` file or rename the `.env.example` file and add the corresponding environment variables as per the example*.
4. Run project: `npm run dev` or `yarn run dev`
5. Add some data in Redis: `npm run seed` or `yarn run seed`
 * *Tip: You can make the **GET** request to fetch data using Swagger UI on the appropriate route.*
6. Run tests: first stop the server and then run either `npm run test` or `yarn run test`

\***Note**: If you want to run Redis as a docker container instead of adding an `.env` file, you can checkout **redis-container** branch of this repo and follow _Project Instalation_ steps in the branch's README.md
